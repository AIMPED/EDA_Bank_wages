# EDA_Bank_wages
This is a training repository where I conducted an EDA.

## Data Set

The data set is rather small (7 columns and 474 rows) and consists of
numerical values and categorical values. I made up a scenario in which 
I as Data Scientist have been asked by the newly hired equal opportunities officer 
of the bank to help him understand the bank structure. 

The equal opportunities officer had specific questions which I should answer:
- How is the gender distribution in the US bank?
- Is there a gender pay gap?
- Do people from minority groups have a disadvantage?
- Is the education directly related to the starting salary?

The presentations **"EDA_US_Bank_Wages.pdf"** tries to answer the raised questions.
